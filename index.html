    <p class="box">
      Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in
      Funchal, Madeira, Portugal. Raised in a modest household, his talent for
      football emerged early, and by the age of 12 he had moved to Lisbon to
      join Sporting CP’s academy. His rapid development and dazzling skills soon
      caught the eye of Europe’s top clubs, setting the stage for an
      extraordinary career.

      In 2003, at just 18 years old, Ronaldo signed with Manchester United.
      Under Sir Alex Ferguson’s mentorship, he evolved from a promising winger
      into one of the most lethal forwards in the game. His time in England
      brought three Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy, and his
      first Ballon d’Or in 2008, establishing him as a global football icon.

      Ronaldo’s 2009 transfer to Real Madrid for a then-world-record fee marked

      scoring 450 goals in 438 appearances. He won four Champions League titles
      and two La Liga trophies with the team, cementing his status as one of the
      greatest players of all time and the face of Madrid’s modern dominance.

      the league’s global profile. On the international stage, he is Portugal’s
      most-capped player and all-time top scorer, leading the nation to victory
      at Euro 2016 and the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019. His
      international tally exceeds 130 goals, a men’s football world record.
